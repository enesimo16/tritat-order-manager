# TRITAT ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

To run the application, you can enter the file named oho.py. To grant access:
USERS = {
    “mudur”: {“password”: “1234”, ‘role’: “manager”},
    “calisan1”: {“password”: “1234”, ‘role’: “employee”},
    “gmudur”: {“password”: “1234”, ‘role’: “manager”},
    “calisan2”: {“password”: “0000”, ‘role’: “employee”} 
    }

The file named tritat.py is just the Python version of my current order management project, presented as a draft.
